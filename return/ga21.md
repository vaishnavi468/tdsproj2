# Step Count Analysis: A Week of Walking

## Introduction
Tracking daily steps is an effective way to monitor physical activity and maintain a healthy lifestyle. This analysis examines the number of steps walked each day over a week, compares trends over time, and evaluates step counts relative to friends.

## Methodology
Data was collected using a smartphone step-tracking app. The comparison was made using:

- **Personal daily steps** recorded for a week.
- *Average* step count to observe trends.
- Comparison with friends' step counts.

## Data Collection
Step data was extracted using the following Python script:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("steps_data.csv")
print(data.head())
```

## Results

### Daily Step Count

| Day        | Steps | Friend's Steps |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| Monday     | 8,000 | 7,500         |
| Tuesday    | 10,200 | 9,800         |
| Wednesday  | 6,500 | 7,000         |
| Thursday   | 12,300 | 11,500        |
| Friday     | 9,600 | 10,000        |
| Saturday   | 11,200 | 12,000        |
| Sunday     | 7,800 | 8,500         |

### Key Observations
1. **Peak activity** was observed on Thursday with 12,300 steps.
2. The lowest step count was on Wednesday with *only* 6,500 steps.
3. The trend aligns with social activities, as higher steps occurred on weekends.

## Conclusion
This study highlights personal walking habits and encourages social motivation through friendly step comparisons. For more details, visit the [CDC’s Physical Activity Guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/).

## Future Improvements
- **Increase sample size** to gain better insights.
- *Incorporate* heart rate and calorie burn data.
- Use machine learning to predict step count trends.

### Sample Code for Future Prediction
To predict future steps, we can use:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

By leveraging historical data, we can forecast step count trends and set realistic fitness goals!

## Additional Notes
The dataset is stored in `steps_data.csv`, and the column names are `Day`, `Steps`, and `Friends_Steps`.
